# Additional Tools

This section covers additional development and testing tools.

## Sections

1. [Postman Setup](./postman.md)
2. [Portal & Public Pages](./portal-setup.md)
3. [Audit Trail Projects](./audit-trail.md)
4. [Elasticsearch Setup](./elasticsearch.md)
5. [Health Check Application](./health-check.md)
6. [Elasticsearch and Kibana](./elasticsearch-kibana.md)

These tools provide additional functionality for API testing, logging, and monitoring.

## Overview

Additional tools enhance the development experience with:

- **API Testing** - Postman collections for Method's APIs
- **Portal Applications** - Method portal and public-facing pages
- **Audit & Logging** - Event tracking and audit trail services  
- **Search & Analytics** - Elasticsearch and Kibana for log analysis
- **Health Monitoring** - System health checks and service validation

ðŸ“‹ **Prerequisites:**
- Core development environment fully configured
- All critical services running successfully
- Docker containers operational

> **Note:** These are optional tools that can be set up as needed. Setup time varies by tool complexity and requirements.

## When to Use These Tools

**During Development:**
- Postman for API testing and debugging
- Health Check for system validation

**For Troubleshooting:**
- Elasticsearch/Kibana for log analysis
- Audit Trail for event tracking

**For Advanced Features:**
- Portal setup for customer-facing development
- Additional monitoring and analytics tools

## Optional vs Required

**Optional Tools:**
- Portal applications (unless working on portal features)
- Elasticsearch/Kibana (unless working with logs)
- Advanced audit trail features

**Recommended Tools:**
- Postman collections (essential for API development)
- Health Check application (critical for validation)
