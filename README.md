## 📄 Original Document

The complete original document is preserved at: `../MethodUI/Developer-Machine-Setup-3.0.md`

This organized structure makes it easier to:
- ✅ Find specific setup information quickly
- ✅ Maintain and update individual sections
- ✅ Track completion progress
- ✅ Troubleshoot specific areas
- ✅ Onboard new team members efficiently

## 💡 Setup Expectations

The setup process varies significantly based on experience level and familiarity with Method's development environment:

- **Experienced developers** familiar with our stack, project layout, and troubleshooting: ~1 day
- **New developers** or those new to our environment: typically 4-8 days

> **Note:** Duration depends on download speeds, machine performance, troubleshooting needs, and prior experience with similar development environments. Focus on following each step carefully rather than rushing through the process.
