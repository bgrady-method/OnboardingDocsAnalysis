### Recommendations

#### High Priority - URGENT FIXES NEEDED ❌
1. **Fix IIS Configuration Broken Links:** Update README.md or create missing files:
   - `enable-features.md` redirect to `troubleshooting/appendix-iis.md`
   - `registry-salt.md`  Section 11.2 content
   - `import-sites.md` redirect to `application-pools.md`
   - Create `legacy-sync-service.md` for Section 11.4 content
   - `https-binding.md` redirect to `ssl-certificates.md`
2. **Verify SQL Content Integration:** Confirm QBO & QBDT backup procedures are properly integrated
3. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure all README files have working links

#### Medium Priority  
1. **Document Onboarding Additions:** Clarify relationship between technical setup and onboarding processes
2. **Consolidate SQL Content:** Verify proper distribution of SQL-related procedures
3. **Update Cross-References:** Ensure internal links work between separated sections

#### Future Considerations
1. **Version Management:** Track which content is net-new vs. reorganized
2. **Maintenance Process:** Establish process for keeping both formats synchronized
3. **User Journey Mapping:** Ensure logical flow is maintained despite structural changes
