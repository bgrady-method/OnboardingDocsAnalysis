# First Week Schedule: From Zero to Local Account

## Overview

This schedule is designed to take you from your first day to having a working local Method account. We've allocated **generous time** for setup because we know there are almost always complications with .NET Core versions, Windows permissions, IIS configs, database backups, or other environmental issues.

**Goal**: Create your first local Method account by the end of the week
**Philosophy**: Learn by doing, with systematic troubleshooting when things go wrong

## Daily Check-in Structure

### Morning Standup (15 minutes)
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or questions?

### Buddy Check-in (30 minutes)
- Review progress from previous day
- Discuss any issues encountered
- Plan for current day's work
- Practice troubleshooting techniques

### End-of-Day Review (15 minutes)
- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- What would you do differently?
- Questions for tomorrow

## Buffer Time Philosophy

We've allocated **2-3 hours of buffer time per day** because:

1. **Environmental Issues**: .NET Core version conflicts, Windows permissions, IIS configuration problems
2. **Database Issues**: Backup restoration failures, permission problems, connection string issues
3. **Learning Curve**: Understanding new concepts takes time
4. **Troubleshooting Practice**: Learning to solve problems is part of the process
5. **Realistic Expectations**: Better to finish early than feel rushed

## When Things Go Wrong

### Common Issues and Time Estimates

| Issue Type | Typical Time to Resolve | Escalation Point |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| .NET Core version conflicts | 1-2 hours | After 2 hours |
| IIS configuration problems | 1-3 hours | After 3 hours |
| Database permission issues | 2-4 hours | After 4 hours |
| Docker container failures | 30 minutes - 2 hours | After 2 hours |
| Network/VPN connectivity | 30 minutes - 1 hour | After 1 hour |

### Escalation Process

1. **Try documented solutions** (15-30 minutes)
2. **Ask your buddy** (they've seen these issues before)
3. **Post in #dev-help** with specific error details
4. **Escalate to platform team** if it's a system-wide issue

### Learning from Failures

Every problem you solve makes you more valuable:
- **Document the solution** for future reference
- **Update our troubleshooting guides** if you find gaps
- **Share your learnings** with other new developers
- **Celebrate the win** - you just leveled up!

## Week 1 Success Metrics

By the end of your first week, you should be able to:

1. **Explain Method's architecture** to a new developer
2. **Troubleshoot common issues** using our decision tree
3. **Create and manage local accounts** independently
4. **Navigate the codebase** to find relevant files
5. **Use our health check system** effectively
6. **Ask for help effectively** when needed

## Preparation for Week 2

At the end of Week 1, you'll be ready to:
- Start working on your first PR
- Understand the code review process
- Begin learning specific Method development patterns
- Contribute to our documentation improvements

Remember: The goal isn't just to get your environment workingâ€”it's to develop the skills and confidence to solve problems independently while knowing when and how to ask for help.
