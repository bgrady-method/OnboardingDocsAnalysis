## Getting Help

### When to Ask for Help
- **Immediately**: Security issues, production problems, access problems
- **After 30 minutes**: Complex technical problems you can't solve
- **After 2 hours**: Any problem that's blocking your progress
- **Always**: When you're unsure about business logic or requirements

### How to Ask for Help
1. **Try first**: Document what you've tried
2. **Be specific**: Include error messages, steps to reproduce, environment details
3. **Show effort**: Demonstrate that you've attempted to solve it yourself
4. **Learn**: Ask questions to understand the solution, not just get it fixed

### Learning from Help
- **Understand the solution**: Don't just apply the fix, understand why it works
- **Document it**: Add to our troubleshooting guides if it's a new issue
- **Share it**: Help the next person who encounters the same problem
- **Prevent it**: Look for ways to prevent the problem from happening again

Remember: The goal isn't to never need help—it's to become the person others come to for help while knowing when and how to ask for it yourself.
